    - input seems to work for now though one crash caused the 
    mouse to stop working
    
    - golang sdl2 does not have 'event.jaxis
    so insted have to use a switch statment on event.(type)
    switch v := event.(type){ ... }
    and catch '*sdl.JoyAxisEvent to get access to joysticks
    'which and 'value variables
** DONE input keyboard not working
    - method to get key press was inside 'if JoySticksInitialised'
    and so was not being called because no joystick was active.
    So just moved it outside if statment within player.HandleInput
