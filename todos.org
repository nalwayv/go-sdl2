    CLOSED: [2019-02-25 Sat]
    
    input seems to work for now though one crash caused the 
    mouse to stop working
    
    golang sdl2 does not have 'event.jaxis
    so instead have to use a 'switch statement on event.(type)
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      switch event.(type){
      case *sdl.JoyAxisEvent:
        // ...
      }
    #+END_SRC
** DONE input keyboard not working
    CLOSED: [2019-02-28 Thu]

    method to get key press was inside 'if JoySticksInitialised block
    and so was not being called if joy as not active.
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      if JoySticksInitialised(){
        // was here
      }
      // now here
    #+END_SRC
** DONE StateMachine index out of range on change
    CLOSED: [2019-03-04]
    had len(...)-1 to get the last elements in the wrong 
    position. 
    it was added before adding a new elements to the slice
** TODO Zero Error Animation Graphic.go
    zero division error causing a go panic()
