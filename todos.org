    - input seems to work for now though one crash caused the 
    mouse to stop working
    
    - golang sdl2 does not have 'event.jaxis
    so instead have to use a 'switch statement on event.(type)
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
    switch v := event.(type){ 
        case *sdl.JoyAxisEvent:  
        // code here
    }    
    #+END_SRC
** DONE input keyboard not working
    CLOSED: [2019-02-28 Thu]

    - method to get key press was inside 'if JoySticksInitialised block
    and so was not being called if joy as not active.
