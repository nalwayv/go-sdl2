** DONE input handler xbox axis sticks not working 
    CLOSED: [2019-02-25 Sat]
    
    input seems to work for now though one crash caused the 
    mouse to stop working
    
    golang sdl2 does not have 'event.jaxis
    so instead have to use a 'switch statement on event.(type)
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      switch event.(type){
      case *sdl.JoyAxisEvent:
        // ...
      }
    #+END_SRC

** DONE input keyboard not working
    CLOSED: [2019-02-28 Thu]

    method to get key press was inside 'if JoySticksInitialised block
    and so was not being called if joy as not active.
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      if JoySticksInitialised(){
        // was here
      }
      // now here
    #+END_SRC

** DONE StateMachine index out of range on change
    CLOSED: [2019-03-04]
    had len(...)-1 to get the last elements in the wrong 
    position. 
    it was added before adding a new elements to the slice

** TODO Zero Error Animation Graphic.go
    zero division error causing a go panic()

** TODO Not working because xml data has yet to be fully implemented
    xml data is not done and some classes have been changed to get that data
    that is not there, so game wont load.

** DONE callback set error within mainmenu
    CLOSED: [2019-03-12]
    used the wrong method 
    was using setCallBackID instead of setCallBack oops!
    - setCallBackID = int
    - setCallBack = func

** TODO nil pointer when registering menu button
